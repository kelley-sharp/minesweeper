# Minesweeper

`React.JS` `TypeScript` `CSS3`

## About

On my first Windows computer in the 90's, Minesweeper was the most difficult of the Entertainment Pack games for me to play. That's why I wanted to build it programmatically from scratch. I still lose often, but the real win is the satisfaction of knowing how it works.

To view the site and play the game go [here](https://kelleysharp-minesweeper.netlify.app/).

## Greatest Challenge

When the player's selected cell does not have a bomb, how does the game search just the neighboring cells and decide which ones to reveal? This involved writing an algorithm that would traverse and reveal neighboring cells whose hidden values are either null or a number. I used a stack data structure to look at the cells and a depth-first search to traverse their neighbors.
